This is the basic data transformation done using SQL and python,
a very simple approach to make data tarnsformations in Postgre SQL,
1. Fetched data from kaggle in csv format,
2. Used Python to convert it into dataframe and dropping null values and save it into Postgres by connecting SQL DB to python file.
3. Used Postgres for Transformation and stored useful data into another table for data processing.
